Blue Road eHP is a user friendly adaptation of the complicated and otherwise hard-to-understand data from the hit mobile game, Azur Lane. It allows the user to easily search for data pertaining to each in-game character rather than manually search through an Excel spreadsheet with thousands of entries.
